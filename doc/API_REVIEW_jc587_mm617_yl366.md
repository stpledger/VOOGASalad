Part 1:
1. Jeremy uses composition heavily, while Martin writes codes to respond to the changes in events frequently.
2. In both Jeremy and Martin's team, front-end(authoring environment and player) and back-end(engine) are separate.
3. In both Jeremy and Martin's team, engine talks with other part via data and event-listener.
4. Jeremy might have errors when different nodes collide with others, while Martin might confront bad data format. They will use exception to handle erorrs.
5. They both think their API is flexible to add new components, and their API is compatible with other parts.

Part 2:
1.Both handle collision checking. They think they are descriptive.
2.Jeremy think he needs a week, while Martin hopes to finish it by Friday. The parts in question 4 make estimation uncertain.
3.Both are excited about doing individual animation module.
4.Jeremy is worried about how to parallelized different state machines of nodes. Martin is worried about shaking problems when multiple collisions happening on the same object.
5.They both to focus on collision checking.
